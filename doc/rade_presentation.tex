% Features are a spectrogram, turns out with modern ML speech synthesisers you can reconstruct speech from that.
% Advances in speech synthesis, step change in quality.
% Training is like taking a few hundred hours of spectrograms, corrupting it with the HF channel, then telling the network to try and reproduce the original.
% Started out as system to encode speech for voice over the internet.  Jean-Marc developed a PoC prototype, I wrapped a modem around it, trained for HF channels. Story of development, use of AREG KiwiSDRs to test system - real science.  Need to move away from anecdotal reports.
% Rapid prototyping, small code example.
% PAPR advantage, greater average power output

% Three takeaways
% 10 contents slides + intro is 20 minutes
% Do a practice run

\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{What is RADE}
\begin{description}
    \item[RADE] Radio Auto-encoder
\end{description}
A way of using machine learning (AI) to send speech over HF radio. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FreeDV project}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open source HF digital voice for amateur radio
    \item Since 2023, funded by ARDC grant
    \item Managed by 6 Person Project Leadership Team
    \item Financial sponsor is the Software Freedom Conservancy

% could use diode or AM radio example
% simple example of network
% extend to unknown black box
% when we don't know what exact function of box is, but have a pretty good idea of what we want it to do
% step changes in the qualitry of many agorithms including speec coding
