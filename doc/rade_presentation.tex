\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\begin{description}
    \item[RADE] Radio Auto-encoder
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
   \item A way of using machine learning (AI) to send speech over HF radio 
   \item Combines traditional DSP and modern ML to encode and decode speech
   \item Connect a PC running RADE to your SSB radio
   \item 8 kHz audio bandwidth, high quality speech
   \item Works at low and high SNRs, handles multipath fading
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	TODO: link to blog post for demo
	TODO: Can sample be embedded in a Beamer presentation?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
RADE is an outcome of the FreeDV Project ...
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open source HF digital voice for amateur radio
    \item Since 2023, funded by an ARDC grant
    \item 6 Person Project Leadership Team
    \item Financial sponsor is the Software Freedom Conservancy
    \item Project Goal: a voice mode competitive with SSB at high and low SNRs
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Design Versus Training}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Previously, we would design a system
	\item Figure out all the steps
	\item With ML the emphasis is on training a neural network
	\item Consider an AM radio example
	% TODO: block diagram of AM radio tuner, detector, filter
	\item Lets build the detector using machine learning
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start with an untrained neural network
	\item Collect some training material
	\item Many examples of input and desired output
	\item Train the network so it matches desired output
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	TODO: slide with plots of network input and output
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sometimes we don't know the best way to design something
	\item Real world problems are complex, prefect designs don't exist
	\item But we do have a good idea of what success looks (sounds) like
	\item So we just treat the system it as a black box
	\item Show it examples of what we would like to see - and train
	\item ML has provided step changes in the quality of many algorithms
	\item Including speech synthesis and compression
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{RADE Design}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Jean-Marc Valin (and team) - compressing speech for Internet applications
    \item Idea: could it could be applied to noisy signal over radio channels?
    \item Jean-Marc developed a quick proof of concept
    \item We wrapped a modem around it to develop RADE
    \item Hams (and AREG SDRs) helped us crowd source the testing
    \item Mooneer Salem integrated RADE with the FreeDV GUI application
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	TODO: Block diagram of RADE versus classical DSP
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example of features - waterfall (aka spectrogram)
	\item Encoder takes waterfall and produces symbols we send over channel
	\item Decoder takes symbols and produces waterfall
	\item Which are fed to a ML synthesiser for high quality speech
	\item Trained with 200 hours of speech, corrupted by noise and the HF channel
	\item Classical DSP modem wrapped around that for synchronisation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
